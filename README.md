# Welcome to webm.tools!

Hi! 

My goal for this project is to have a simple UI, with huge range of conversions and options to convert ANY video format to WebM. 

I won't be taking any initial funding; but may reconsider if things pickup and server costs become out of hand.


# Design
Each user session will be unique and all activities will run within its context. Open Source means users won't need to be fearful that their video ends up in the wrong hands.

The entire process is virtually anonymous and our only identification for a user would be based on IP.

Videos converted could be stored in memory/temp disk until verified claimed, timed-out without claim, or the user manually expires their session.
